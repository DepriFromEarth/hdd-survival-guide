# hdd-survival-guide
A guide for people still on HDDs in the modern age where SSDs control the world!

## Questions you should ask yourself before starting this guide

1. Do I have an SSD and HDD? If you do, then follow this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG4LXw4Nd5U

2. Do I have only 1 or more HDDs? If so, continue with the rest of the guide!

3. Am I on Windows or Linux?

## Where to Begin?
- If you are on Windows proceed here.

- If you are on Linux proceed here.

## Windows

Before we start, we have to find out which type of BIOS we have so we can choose the proper partitioning style.
After we find this out, we can wipe the drive and install Windows again if we have the improper style for whatever reason.
If you are already using the proper style, you can skip this step.

Open "Run" with the Windows key, type in "msinfo32," and press enter. If it isn't already there, click System summary to bring us to the correct page.
Find "BIOS Mode" It will say "Legacy" or "UEFI." If it displays legacy, we will use the MBR partitioning style; if it displays UEFI, we will use GPT.

You can break these rules if your hard drive has 2TiBs or more.
This will require you to use GPT regardless of whether you have a legacy BIOS because MBR simply doesn't support over 2TiBs, the extra space will be lost.

Now type in Run, "diskmgmt.msc". Right click your disk and select properties. Then goto "Volumes".
Here we can see if our partitsioning style is MBR or GPT. If everything matches with our BIOS Mode nothing needs to be done!
If we have MBR but our BIOS is UEFI I suggest you reinstall Windows with the GPT style for greater storage and speeds.
If we have GPT but our BIOS is legacy and the drive is 2TiBs+ we don't have to do anything.

Do not try to mix and match GPT and MBR partitioning styles with each other because issues can arise.

There are multiple ways to reinstall Windows, so I will not go over that here, but I suggest using Rufus and selecting the right partition style, then burn the desired iso to the USB.

Now that we have reinstalled Windows or simply checked that everything is okay, we will short-stroke our hard drive to increase the minimum speeds of the drive.
Please follow this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toLYV7th0L8
And here's a link to HDD Tune:http://www.hdtune.com/download.html

Install the Windows Performance Tool Kit, then reboot your system. https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive/

After that, we need to enable a couple services and set them to automatic.
By default, they should be like this, but just in case, we will enable them if they get disabled somehow.

1. Open Run once again and type "services.msc" Find Superfetch or Sysmain on Windows10+.
Set the startup type to automatic and start the services.
Then click Apply and OK.

2. Type "regedit" and press Enter.
Navigate to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMControlSet001ControlSession ManagerMemory ManagementPrefetchParameters] and then to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMControlSet001ControlSession ManagerMe
Find "EnablePrefetcher" and "EnableSuperfetch" and set their values to 3.

Now open a command prompt with admin rights and type
xbootmgr -trace boot -prepSystem -verboseReadyBoot

USE ONLY THE INCLUDED MS TOOL AFTER THE OPTIMIZATION, BECAUSE EVERY TOOL PLACES THE FILES AT A DIFFERENT OFFSET ON YOUR HDD, BECAUSE ALL TOOLS THINK THEY KNOW IT BETTER!

I suggest leaving the write-buffer cache on, and it should be by default, but if you are worried about data loss, it's completely fine to disable it, but speeds may suffer. You can check if it on by opening Run and typing "devmgmt.msc" look for "Disk drives" collapse the section and right click your desired drive, then go into policies to disable or enable it.

Now we will optimize the file system. I will being using changes suggest by amitxv

Open CMD & enter the commands below.

Disables the creation of 8.3 character-length file names on FAT- & NTFS-formatted volumes

fsutil behavior set disable8dot3 1
Disable updates to the Last Access Time stamp on each directory when directories are listed on an NTFS volume

fsutil behavior set disablelastaccess 1
Enables delete notifications (also known as trim or unmap), should be enabled by default but here for safe measure

fsutil behavior set disabledeletenotify 0

I personally think you should disable Event Trace Sessions but if you need them for logging

Create registry files to toggle event trace sessions. Programs that rely on event tracers such will not be able to log data until the required sessions are restored which is the purpose of creating two registry files to toggle between them (identical concept to the service scripts). Open CMD and enter the commands below to build the registry files in the C:\ directory. As with the services scripts, these registry files must be ran with NSudo.

reg export "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger" "C:\ets-enable.reg"
>> "C:\ets-disable.reg" echo Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
>> "C:\ets-disable.reg" echo.
>> "C:\ets-disable.reg" echo [-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger]

Now we will look at cleaning junk files or unwanted programs.

I recommend the following programs for junk removal:
Bleachbit (FOSS)
Cleanmgr+ (FOSS)
BCUninstaller (FOSS)
RevoUninstaller
Autoruns
I suggest using the portable versions of these programs.

If you do not wish to use a program for whatever reason and just use the Windows tools to clean your system continue here;

Some locations you may want to review for leftover bloatware and unwanted shortcutsÂ 

"C:\"
"C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"
"C:\Program Files"
"C:\ProgramData"
"C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\download"
"C:\Windows\Temp"
"%userprofile%\AppData"
"%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Temp"
"%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"
"%userprofile%\Downloads"

or

Open CMD and the command below to open all folders listed above at once
for %a in ("C:\", "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs", "C:\Program Files", "C:\ProgramData", "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\download", "C:\Windows\Temp", "%userprofile%\AppData", "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Temp", "%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs", "%userprofile%\Downloads") do (explorer %a)
Configure Disk Cleanup

Open CMD and enter the command below, tick all of the boxes, press OK

cleanmgr /sageset:50
Run Disk Cleanup

cleanmgr /sagerun:50

Then, in Task Scheduler, delete or disable all of the tasks.

Open Run and type msconfig then goto startup and click Disable All. (Windows 7, 8, XP and Vista)
If you are on Windows 10+ you'll have to open up Task Manager and disable startups from there, or press Windows key + I and go to Apps, then Startup, and disable each app.

Now that we have done all that, we can discuss defragging programs.

do not use;
O&O Defrag
UltraDefrag
Defraggler
Auslogics Disk Defrag
Puran Defragmenter
My Defragmenter
IOBit Smart Defrag
Glarysoft Disk SpeedUp
Toolwiz Smart Defrag
Wise Care 365
Systweak Advanced System
Fragger
PerfectDisk Pro
UltimateDisk Defrag
Condusiv Diskeeper
Baidu PC Faster for Windows
MyDefrag
VoptXP
etc.

I can only suggest using Contig or the default Windows defragmenter.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/contig
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contig_(defragmentation_utility)
https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/power_defragmenter_gui.html

When Should I defrag? When the system is around 56% fragmented. Constantly defragging may prematurely kill your drive.
Avoid tapping the drive or a rumbly environment since this will affect the phsyical header.

A video to check if your hard drive is dying: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGOHA-t6j6M

## Linux
A Linux Section will be added later

Now enter BIOS and look for storage configuration.Find your hard drive and set the SATA controller to ACHI. It should be like this by default, but if it isn't, enable it. Doing so will enable NCQ and allow the physical header to optimize where files should go. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Command_Queuing
